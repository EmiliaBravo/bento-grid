## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This project allowed me to further develop my CSS, grid layout & RWD skills. I also wanted to practice building a scalable design, that's why I used rem units almost exclusively throughout the project. I think it worked rather well, as you can see on the 880px screen size threshold.
